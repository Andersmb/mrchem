==================================
Welcome to MRChem's documentation!
==================================

MRChem is a numerical real-space code for molecular 
electronic structure calculations within the self-consistent field (SCF)
approximations of quantum chemistry (Hartree-Fock and Density Functional
Theory). The code is divided in two main parts: the MultiResolution 
Computation Program Package (MRCPP), which is a general purpose numerical 
mathematics library based on multiresolution analysis and the multiwavelet 
basis which provide low-scaling algorithms as well as rigorous error control 
in numerical computations, and the MultiResolution Chemistry (MRChem) program 
that uses the functionalities of MRCPP for computational chemistry applications.

The code is being developed at the `Centre for Theoretical and Computational 
Chemistry <http://www.ctcc.no/>`_ (CTCC) at 
`UiT - The Arctic University of Norway <http://en.uit.no>`_.
